To run RunAll_2014csb1040.m , you need to give input the path which contains fashion-mnist_test.csv and fashion-mnist_train.csv files. 
For example. 'E:\Academics\7th Semester\Computer Vision\Lab 3\'
Make sure you put the backward slashes properly. 
Make sure you have these two files in the folder. I am not including them because of their large size. Include them too.


A folder 'kmeans' will automatically be created and inside that folder you will see '250' folder which contains idx, C, sumd and D matrices of k-means clustering. 
Other files viz. testFeatures, trainFeatures, testVector, trainVector, labelTrain, labelTest etc.
